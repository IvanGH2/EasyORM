EasyORM library - BETA 

The EasyORM library is a lightweight (~40kB) O/R mapping library designed to be easy and intuitive to use.  It 
targets mostly small to mid-sized projects that communicate with a database either directly or through a web container (e.g Tomcat)


What EasyORM does

- wraps the JDBC API

- pools and reuses database connections via the ConnectionPool class

- supports simple transaction management via the DBTransaction class including commits, rollbacks and isolation levels

- maps result sets to plain Java objects  and persists Java objects to a database (O/R mapping)

- supports the active record pattern enhanced to an active range pattern

- supports creating queries on the fly 

- provides some generic query methods that work on any Java type

- provides support for tables and views

- provides integrated logging 

- includes a POJO generator functionality


What EasyORM does not do

- it does not support EJB, JPA or any other JavaEE technologies

- it does not try to convert an incompatible Java type to an SQL type (e.g. Long/long to Date etc)
