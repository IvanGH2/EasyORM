EasyORM library - BETA 

The EasyORM library is a lightweight (~35kB) O/R mapping library designed to be easy and intuitive to use.  It 
targets mostly small to mid-sized projects that communicate with a database either directly or through a web container (e.g Tomcat)


WHAT EasyORM DOES

- wraps the JDBC API

- pools and reuses database connections via the ConnectionPool class

- supports simple transaction management via the DBTransaction class including commits, rollbacks and isolation levels

- maps result sets to plain Java objects and persists Java objects to a database (O/R mapping)

- supports the active record pattern enhanced to an active range pattern

- supports creating queries on the fly 

- provides some generic query methods that work on any Java type

- provides support for tables and views

- provides exception handling support through the EasyORMException class (this class maps most checked exceptions)

- provides integrated logging 

- no need for any third party libraries or xml-s (annotations are used instead)


WHAT EasyORM DOES NOT DO

- it does not support EJB, JPA or any other JavaEE technologies

- it does not try to convert an incompatible Java type to an SQL type (e.g. Long/long to Date etc)
